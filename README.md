This is my WebScraping example.  It is WORK IN PROGRESS

It is based on a Node.js framework.

I'm using Cheerio.js and Request.js to get tabulated data from an external website and save it as JSON.

I upload the JSON and inject it into the view as a table.

The injector code is fairly DRY but scraping code wants refactoring as I repeat too much code, this is work in progress.
